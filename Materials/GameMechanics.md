# Dusk and Dig

The Dusk and Dig Game is an exciting combination of a 3D city building game and a 2D action game. This unique hybrid offers diverse gameplay experiences and challenges.

## Day/Night System
The game features a dynamic day/night system. From 8:00 to 20:00, the game is in 3D mode, allowing you to build and manage your city and buildings. During the remaining hours, it switches to a 2D action mode, where you explore caverns, getter materials and engage in thrilling combat.

### Time Balance
While both the city building and action phases last for 12 hours, the time is not balanced equally. City building time is compressed, with each in-game hour representing 20 seconds (12 in-game hours = 4 minutes). In contrast, the action phase is more extended, with each in-game hour representing 30 seconds (12 in-game hours = 6 minutes).

## City Building
During the city building phase, you can construct and manage various buildings to develop your city. There are four essential buildings available:

### Ore Processing
The Ore Processing building allows you to convert raw ores that you get in the 2D world, into ingots. To access the processing menu, you need to be in close proximity to the building. Processed materials are vital for upgrading buildings and crafting advanced items.

### Hospital
The Hospital serves as a healing facility for the player. When within range, you can regenerate your health. It's crucial to maintain your health as you venture into the action phase.

### Workshop
The Workshop enables you to craft gear, including armor and swords. There are three tiers of gear: iron, gold, and diamond. Each tier requires different ingots and materials, offering varying attack damage and shield protection. Craft powerful gear to prepare for the action phase. To access the workshop menu, you need to be in close proximity to the building.

### Beacon
The Beacon is a special building that enhances attributes during the action phase. It provides bonuses, such as increased attack damage, to aid you in combat. Upgrade the Beacon to unlock additional benefits.

## Building Upgrades
Each building has between three and four tiers that can be upgraded using processed materials, such as ingots or diamonds. Upgrading buildings enhances their functionality, efficiency, and unlocks new features. Plan your upgrades strategically to optimize your city's growth.

## 2D Action Gameplay
During the action phase, you enter a 2D environment set in caverns filled with valuable ores and guarded by enemies. Your objectives are to mine ores and defeat enemies.

### Mining Ores
Clicking on an ore allows you to mine it. The availability of different ores is determined by the current day, with ore spawn rates varying accordingly. Collect ores to gather resources for your city building endeavors.

### Combat
Engage in thrilling combat with enemies within the caverns. Enemies become progressively stronger as the days advance, dealing more damage and having increased health. Use your crafted gear and combat skills to defeat the enemies and progress further.
